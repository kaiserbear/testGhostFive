Have respect for your opponents, the officials and your\nteam mates.\n\nHome Games:\n\nRemember that there are lots of things to organise before and after the game\nsuch as wickets, the score box, boundaries, sightscreens, shutters, roping off\nthe square, manning the bar on Sunday evenings etc. Please don’t wait to be\nasked to help out. After the game these tasks should be completed as soon as\npossible. If you need to leave early then please arrive early to help out (and\nvice versa).\n\nTeas – make sure that your opponents and officials are served first. In\nparticular, please ensure that some tea is kept aside for the scorers whose job\nmeans they will be last to refreshments.\n\nAway Games:\n\nMake every effort to get to the ground in plenty of time to warm up etc. If you\nare driving then please look up the venue and determine your own directions in\nadvance of the game – don’t either leave it until the last minute or rely solely\non the captain.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the team could stay at an away ground for at least 30\nminutes after the game to share a drink with their opponents – it is after all\nwhat we would expect visitors to CCC to do.\n\nOfficiating:\n\nIn games where the players are required to umpire or score, please do your share\nand don’t wait to be asked!\n\nAnd finally……and most importantly:\n\nWe are a social club so please concentrate on enjoying yourselves and having a\ngood time. If we all work together and adhere to the standards above, score lots\nof runs, take lots of wickets and hold lots of catches, then we will have a\nsuccessful, united and happy club!","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"page","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-03-11T09:44:04.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-03-11T09:44:23.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2022-03-11T09:44:23.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"622b1b8ad284ce001dd4227f","uuid":"f2c8093d-b1bd-4a82-8e01-9ec20f52e761","title":"Spirit of cricket","slug":"the-spirit-of-cricket","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that is should be played not only within the Laws but within the Spirit of the Game.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Any action which is seen to abuse the spirit causes injury to the game itself.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The major responsibility for ensuring the spirit of fair play rests with the captains.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],0,\"1.\"],[0,[],0,\" \"],[0,[],1,\"There are two Laws which place the responsibility for the team’s conduct firmly on the captain.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"Responsibility of captains\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of the Game as well as within the Laws.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"Player’s conduct\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In the event of a player failing to comply with instructions by an umpire, or criticising by word or action the decisions of an umpire, or showing dissent, or generally behaving in a manner which might bring the game into disrepute, the umpire concerned shall in the first place report the matter to the other umpire and to the player’s captain, and instruct the latter to take action.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],0,\"2.\"],[0,[],0,\" \"],[0,[],1,\"Fair and unfair play\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"According to the Laws the umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The umpires may intervene at any time and it is the responsibility of the captain to take action where required.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"3.\"],[0,[],0,\" \"],[0,[0],1,\"The umpires are authorised to intervene in cases of:\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Time wasting\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Damaging the pitch\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Dangerous or unfair bowling\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Tampering with the ball\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Any other action that they consider to be unfair\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"4.\"],[0,[],0,\" \"],[0,[0],1,\"The Spirit of the Game involves RESPECT for:\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Your opponents\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Your own captain and team\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The role of the umpires\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The game’s traditional values\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"5.
